```js
const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");
const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
const completion = await openai.createChatCompletion({
  // focus(1:16)
  // link[3:7] #model
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  // link[3:10] #messages
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
    { role: "user", content: "Hello world" },
  ],
  functions: [{ name: "foo", description: "foo bar baz", parameters: {} }],
  function_call: "auto",
  user: undefined,
  stream: false,
  temperature: 1,
  top_p: 1,
  n: 1,
  max_tokens: Math.infinity,
  presence_penalty: 0,
  frequency_penalty: 0,
  logit_bias: null,
});
console.log(completion.data);
```

Given a list of messages comprising a conversation, the model will return a response.

## API key

You'll need a _`OPENAI_API_KEY`_.

The OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. Visit your [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) page to retrieve the API key you'll use in your requests.

**Remember that your API key is a secret!** Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). Production requests must be routed through your own backend server where your API key can be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service.

## Model

```js

```

_`model`_ is a required field.

It should be one of:

- `gpt-4` June 27th, 2023 from gpt-4-0314 to gpt-4-0613
- `gpt-4-0613`
- `gpt-4-32k`
- `gpt-4-32k-0613`
- `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613`
- `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`
- `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613`

`gpt-3.5-turbo` models are cheaper and faster.
`gpt-4` models have broader general knowledge and advanced reasoning. You need to [ask for access](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api) to use them.
